# A schema for *Campylobacter jejuni* and *Campylobacter coli*

## Schema validation
The **wgMLST** schema for [*Campylobacter coli*](https://github.com/INNUENDOCON/chewBBACA_schema/blob/master/Campylobactercoli.md) have been populated with the **6,685** [*Campylobacter jejuni* genomes](https://github.com/INNUENDOCON/chewBBACA_schema/blob/master/Campylobacterjejuni.md). The *C. jejuni/C. coli* wgMLST schema have been curated excluding all those loci detected as “Repeated Loci” and loci annotated as “non-informative paralogous hit (NIPH/ NIPHEM)” or “Allele Larger/ Smaller than length mode (ALM/ ASM)” by the [*chewBBACA Allele Calling*](https://github.com/B-UMMI/chewBBACA/wiki/2.-Allele-Calling) engine in more than 1% of the [*C. jejuni*](https://github.com/INNUENDOCON/chewBBACA_schema/blob/master/Campylobacterjejuni.md) and [*C. coli*](https://github.com/INNUENDOCON/chewBBACA_schema/blob/master/Campylobactercoli.md) genomes datasets. 

## wgMLST schema
The ***C. jejuni/C. coli* wgMLST schema** includes a total of **1,732 loci**.

## core genome MLST (cgMLST) profile
The **cgMLST profile**, defined as the loci presence in at least the **99.9% of the samples**, consists of **460 loci**. Genomes have no more than 2% of missing loci.
