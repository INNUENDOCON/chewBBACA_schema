# *Campylobacter jejuni*

## Dataset
The dataset is composed by a total of **6,706** genomes. A total of  **5,693** whole genome sequences illumina raw reads of entries deposited in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) as *Campylobacter jejuni* at the time of the analysis (November 2016) were retrieved.  Additionally, the dataset contains **519** genomes previously published in [Kovanen et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27041390), [Llarena et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28348829) [Kovanen et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25232158) and [Kovanen et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655229) and 493 new genomes of *C. jejuni* strains collected from 5 European countries in 22 years and isolated from 12 different hosts were sequenced (277 of which belonging to the **[INNUENDO Sequence Dataset](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxpbm51ZW5kb2NvbnxneDo2YmYyOGU0MjE4ZGJiMmQ0)**). Genomes were assembled using [INNUca v3.1 pipeline](https://github.com/INNUENDOCON/INNUca) and passed the QC.

## Schema creation and validation


## wgMLST schema
The **wgMLST *C. jejuni* schema** included a total of **loci**.

* [schema *C. jejuni* (7z archive)]()
* [wgMLST allele profile of 6,706 *C. jejuni*]()

## core genome MLST (cgMLST) profile
The **cgMLST profile**, defined as the loci presence in at least the **99.9% of the samples**, consists of **loci**. Genomes have no more than 2% of missing loci.
